This contains the scripts and files needed to put GitLab into a "maintenance mode". Before running the
deny_gitlab_access.sh, the maintenance file must be placed in /etc/nginx/sites-available.



Files in this folder:
  maintenance               - This is to be placed in /etc/nginx/sites-available.  This will be enabled when entering
                              maintenance mode.  Must be edited to have correct server_name.
  deny_gitlab_access.sh     - Will cause nginx to redirect to the 503_error.html page, and deny ssh access to the git
                              user.
  do_full_backup.sh         - Shuts down http and ssh access to gitlab, waits 30 seconds for any pending transactions
                              to complete, does a full backup (DB and repos) to the /gitlab/backups, then reinstates
                              http and ssh access.
  public/503_error.html     - Simple error page informing user that GitLab is unavailable.
